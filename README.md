This folder contains exercises to try and implement some machine learning algorithm in python. 
This algorithm I believe are useful for a lot of Data Science and Machine Learning stuffs Major packages used include scipy, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow and other python analytics library. 
The aim of the project is to implement necessary algorithms that are uesful in building AI projects starting with the good old Symbolic AI through the evolution of machine learning and statistical AI

To do this, here are the breadown of the important concepts.


1. Symbolic AI - Here we implement algorithms that uses logics and search in building Artificial Intelligent agent   Starting with Logic, write algorithms that model set theory, model theory, recursion theory and proof theory.
    Here is a link to have an idea of logics and search and how they are used in building AI. http://www.pling.org.uk/cs/lpa.html
2. Sub-Symbolic AI - Here we implement algoithms that uses learning
   Examples include 
   * Machine Learning Algorithms
   * Fuzzy Systems and the algorithms used
   * Evolutionary compution and the algorithms used
   * Swarm Intelligence and the algorithms used
   * Probabilistic learning with Bayesian Network/Hidden Markov model and Kalman Filters
   * Chaos Theory and it's algorithms
3. Statistical AI
